#### Intro:

This is a lightweight mobile device detection algorithm for CodeIgniter.

#### Installation:

You can either use http://getsparks.org to install via the spark installer.  Visit http://getsparks.org/packages/mobiledetection/versions/HEAD/show to install it.

or

1. Extract the archive you get from here.
2. Put libraries/mobiledetection.php into your applications libraries diectory.


#### Usage:

If you've installed via the spark then add the following to your controller.

`$this->load->spark('mobiledetection/x.x');`

or 

`$this->load->library('mobiledetection');`

From there on call the following function to determine if your visitor is using a mobile device.

`$this->mobiledetection->isMobile();`

True is returned if they are, otherwise false is returned.
